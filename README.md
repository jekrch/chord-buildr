# Chord Buildr

Chord Builder was created to make it easy for musicians and music enthusiasts to explore and share chord progressions. 

Users can specify a series of chords, see their notes displayed on interactive keyboards, transpose them, and play audio.  Progressions are encoded in the url, which can be saved for future reference or sent to other users.

Chord Buildr is built with React and uses Tone.js for audio playback.

<b>v1.1</b>
<br/>
<br/>
The UI has been redesigned for mobile to enable the user to see more of the keyboard. This is only used when the screen is in the portrait orientation.

<br/>
<br/>
<b>v1.2</b>
<br/>
<br/>
Users can now choose to display flats instead of sharps for a given chord piano by checking the checkbox labeled 'b' (for flat). This is reflected in all references to the chord and encoded in the url. More chord types were also added and various security updates were made.
