# Chord Buildr :musical_keyboard:

[www.chordbuildr.com](https://www.chordbuildr.com)

Chord Buildr was created to make it easy for musicians and music enthusiasts to explore and share chord progressions. Users can specify a series of chords, see their notes displayed on interactive keyboards, transpose them, and play audio. Progressions are encoded in the URL, which can be saved for future reference or shared with others.

Chord Buildr is implemented in React and uses Tone.js for audio playback.
