# Chord Buildr

Chord Builder was created to make it easy for musicians and music enthusiasts to explore and share chord progressions. 

Users can specify a series of chords, see their notes displayed on interactive keyboards, transpose them, and play audio.  Progressions are encoded in the url, which can be saved for future reference or sent to other users.

Chord Buildr is built with React and uses Tone.js for audio playback.
